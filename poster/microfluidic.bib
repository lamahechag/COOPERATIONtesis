abstract = {Using an active approach to preventing biofilm formation, we implemented a microfluidic bioreactor that enables long-term culture and monitoring of extremely small populations of bacteria with single-cell resolution. We used this device to observe the dynamics of Escherichia coli carrying a synthetic "population control" circuit that regulates cell density through a feedback mechanism based on quorum sensing. The microfluidic bioreactor enabled long-term monitoring of unnatural behavior programmed by the synthetic circuit, which included sustained oscillations in cell density and associated morphological changes, over hundreds of hours.},

@article{Rowat2009,
abstract = {Cells within a genetically identical population exhibit phenotypic variation that in some cases can persist across multiple generations. However, information about the temporal variation and familial dependence of protein levels remains hidden when studying the population as an ensemble. To correlate phenotypes with the age and genealogy of single cells over time, we developed a microfluidic device that enables us to track multiple lineages in parallel by trapping single cells and constraining them to grow in lines for as many as 8 divisions. To illustrate the utility of this method, we investigate lineages of cells expressing one of 3 naturally regulated proteins, each with a different representative expression behavior. Within lineages deriving from single cells, we observe genealogically related clusters of cells with similar phenotype; cluster sizes vary markedly among the 3 proteins, suggesting that the time scale of phenotypic persistence is protein-specific. Growing lines of cells also allows us to dynamically track temporal fluctuations in protein levels at the same time as pedigree relationships among the cells as they divide in the chambers. We observe bursts in expression levels of the heat shock protein Hsp12-GFP that occur simultaneously in mother and daughter cells. In contrast, the ribosomal protein Rps8b-GFP shows relatively constant levels of expression over time. This method is an essential step toward understanding the time scales of phenotypic variation and correlations in phenotype among single cells within a population.},

@article{Lee2007,
abstract = {Manipulation of biological cells using a CMOS/microfluidic hybrid system is demonstrated. The hybrid system starts with a custom-designed CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) chip fabricated in a semiconductor foundry. A microfluidic channel is post-fabricated on top of the CMOS chip to provide biocompatible environments. The motion of individual biological cells that are tagged with magnetic beads is directly controlled by the CMOS chip that generates microscopic magnetic field patterns using an on-chip array of micro-electromagnets. Furthermore, the CMOS chip allows high-speed and programmable reconfiguration of the magnetic fields, substantially increasing the manipulation capability of the hybrid system. Extending from previous work that verified the concept of the hybrid system, this paper reports a set of manipulation experiments with biological cells, which further confirms the advantage of the hybrid approach. To enhance the biocompatibility of the system, the microfluidic channel is redesigned and the temperature of the device is monitored by on-chip sensors. Combining microelectronics and microfluidics, the CMOS/microfluidic hybrid system presents a new model for a cell manipulation platform in biological and biomedical applications.},
