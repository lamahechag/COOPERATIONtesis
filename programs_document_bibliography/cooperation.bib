Abstract = {The sociobiology of bacteria, largely unappreciated and ignored by the microbiology research community two decades ago is now a major research area, catalyzed to a significant degree by studies of communication and cooperative behavior among the myxobacteria and in quorum sensing (QS) and biofilm formation by pseudomonads and other microbes. Recently, the topic of multicellular cooperative behaviors among bacteria has been increasingly considered in the context of evolutionary biology. Here we discuss the significance of two recent studies of the phenomenon of "cheating" mutants and their exploitation of cooperating microbial populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

@article{Traulsen2006,
abstract = {We propose a minimalist stochastic model of multilevel (or group) selection. A population is subdivided into groups. Individuals interact with other members of the group in an evolutionary game that determines their fitness. Individuals reproduce, and offspring are added to the same group. If a group reaches a certain size, it can split into two. Faster reproducing individuals lead to larger groups that split more often. In our model, higher-level selection emerges as a byproduct of individual reproduction and population structure. We derive a fundamental condition for the evolution of cooperation by group selection: if b/c > 1 + n/m, then group selection favors cooperation. The parameters b and c denote the benefit and cost of the altruistic act, whereas n and m denote the maximum group size and the number of groups. The model can be extended to more than two levels of selection and to include migration.},

@article{Gore2009,
Abstract = {The origin of cooperation is a central challenge to our understanding of evolution. The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest in microbial models of cooperation and competition. For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase. This hydrolysis reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate that the vast majority ( approximately 99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative behaviour. A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what game theorists call the snowdrift game. A model of the cooperative interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift game-wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells.},

Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another.

Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection.

@article{Goodnight1997,
Abstract = {The study of group selection has developed along two autonomous lines. One approach, which we refer to as the adaptationist school, seeks to understand the evolution of existing traits by examining plausible mechanisms for their evolution and persistence. The other approach, which we refer to as the genetic school, seeks to examine how currently acting artificial or natural selection changes traits within populations and focuses on current evolutionary change. The levels of selection debate lies mainly within the adaptationist school, whereas the experimental studies of group selection lie within the genetic school. Because of the very different traditions and goals of these two schools, the experimental studies of group selection have not had a major impact on the group selection debate. We review the experimental results of the genetic school in the context of the group selection controversy and address the following questions: Under what conditions is group selection effective? What is the genetic basis of a response to group selection? How common is group selection in nature?},

@article{Hegreness2006,abstract = {Rapid evolution of asexual populations, such as that of cancer cells or of microorganisms developing drug resistance, can include the simultaneous spread of distinct beneficial mutations. We demonstrate that evolution in such cases is driven by the fitness effects and appearance times of only a small minority of favorable mutations. The complexity of the mutation-selection process is thereby greatly reduced, and much of the evolutionary dynamics can be encapsulated in two parameters-an effective selection coefficient and effective rate of beneficial mutations. We confirm this theoretical finding and estimate the effective parameters for evolving populations of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli. The effective parameters constitute a simple description and provide a natural standard for comparing adaptation between species and across environments.},author = {Hegreness, Matthew and Shoresh, Noam and Hartl, Daniel and Kishony, Roy},doi = {10.1126/science.1122469},file = {:Users/alejandromahecha/Documents/System-biology/COOPERATION/Hegreness\_2006.pdf:pdf},issn = {1095-9203},journal = {Science (New York, N.Y.)},keywords = {Adaptation, Biological,Bacterial Proteins,Bacterial Proteins: analysis,Bacterial Proteins: genetics,Biological Evolution,Escherichia coli,Escherichia coli: genetics,Escherichia coli: physiology,Genetics, Population,Green Fluorescent Proteins,Green Fluorescent Proteins: analysis,Green Fluorescent Proteins: genetics,Luminescent Proteins,Luminescent Proteins: analysis,Luminescent Proteins: genetics,Mathematics,Models, Genetic,Mutation},month = mar,number = {5767},pages = {1615--7},pmid = {16543462},title = {{An equivalence principle for the incorporation of favorable mutations in asexual populations.}},url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16543462},volume = {311},year = {2006}}
@article{Fraser2009,abstract = {Phenotypic diversification plays a central role in evolution and provides species with a capacity to survive environmental adversity. The profound impact of random molecular events on the shaping of life is well accepted in the context of chance mutations and genetic drift; however, the evolution of the regulatory networks encoding microorganismal stress response and survival strategies might also have been significantly influenced by gene expression noise. This likelihood has inspired numerous investigations to characterize the sources of phenotypic diversity within isogenic populations, and to explore their direct and potential biological implications. Here, we discuss different scenarios where gene expression noise might bestow a selective advantage under stress, highlighting a potentially fundamental role of stochastic mechanisms in the evolution of microbial survival strategies.},author = {Fraser, Dawn and Kaern, Mads},doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06605.x},file = {:Users/alejandromahecha/Documents/System-biology/COOPERATION/fraser\_kaern\_mol\_microb\_09\_rev.PDF:PDF},issn = {1365-2958},journal = {Molecular microbiology},keywords = {Adaptation, Physiological,Adaptation, Physiological: genetics,Ecosystem,Environment,Evolution, Molecular,Gene Expression,Genetics, Population,Mutation,Phenotype,Stochastic Processes,Stress, Physiological},month = mar,number = {6},pages = {1333--40},pmid = {19220745},title = {{A chance at survival: gene expression noise and phenotypic diversification strategies.}},url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19220745},volume = {71},year = {2009}}
